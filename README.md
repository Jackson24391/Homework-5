# Homework-5

## Description

This application was developed to keep track of things to do during the day. It has text entry boxes beside the times for you to enter what it is that needs to be done during that time.

## Installation

It can be deployed through the GitHub pages or link
https://jackson24391.github.io/Homework-5/ 

## Usage

When accessed through the GitHub pages you are brought to a screen that may have multiple colors depending on the time of day. The colors represent the past (green), present (blue), and future (purple). 
Next to all the times are text entry boxes which can be used as a list of things that are in the allotted time slots. You'll use the colored rows as a quick reference to what needs to be done, what's completed, and what's to come.
You can also save what you put into the boxes by clicking the file button to the left. It will be console logged and when returned to it will be saved.
